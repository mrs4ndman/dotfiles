 Ctrl + u = Goes half a page up | Sube media página

 Ctrl + f = Goes a full page down / forward
 Ctrl + b = Goes a full page up / backward
 
 K = man page for word below cursor

 x = The better way to delete characters
 b & w = Jump backwards and forwards to the next word / different format of text (no need for space)
 W = Jump to the next space-separated text

 F<char> = Goes backwards to the specified character in the line (e.g. <) 

 T<char> = Jumps to right after the previous specified character in the line (e.g. = ) 
    T<char> is a mirror of t<char>, same with f & F

    ct<char> changes from the cursor To right before the next specified character in the line
    cT<char> changes from the cursor To right after the previous specified character in the line 

    pf<char> pastes From the cursor to the next specified character in the line 
    pF<char> pastes From the cursor to the previous specified character in the line
    pt<char> pastes from the cursor To right before the next specified character in the line
    pT<char> pastes from the cursor To right after the previous specified character in the line 


 INSERT:

 i = Enter insert mode right on the cursor
 I = Enter insert mode, but position the cursor at the beginning of the line
 a = Enter insert mode, but right after the cursor
 A = Enter insert mode, but right over the end of the line
 o = Enter insert mode, but in a new line below the one we're in
 O = Enter insert mode, but in a new line above the one we're in
 

 VISUAL:

 V: Selects current line (can overwrite it by pasting it)





NVIM: Custom keybinds with space as leader & modal keybinds for easy motions


(assuming Space is leader in neovim)

 Q = Manually unbound in config (do not need it)

 Ctrl + q = :q! <CR>
 Ctrl + w = :w <CR>
 
 Ctrl + d = Goes half a page down / forward

 Ctrl + f = Goes a full page down / forward
 Ctrl + b = Goes a full page up / backward


 INSERT:

 Ctrl + c = Escape (i know, right?)
