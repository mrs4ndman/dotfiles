# Them keybinds

#### Got most of the binds from [him](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) 
#### and his [config files](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)

## VIM / NVIM base modal motions & keybinds

- ### NORMAL:

    - Ctrl + a = Iterate the number under the cursor

	- Ctrl + f = Goes a full page down / forward | Baja una p치gina entera
	
	- Ctrl + b = Goes a full page up / backward | Baja una p치gina entera


	- x = The better way to delete characters
	
    - = = Indents the current line correctly

    - =ap = Indents the whole paragraph & surrounding whitespace

    - \> = Can be combined with a selection or motion to indent x number of lines
    
    - \< = Can be combined with a selection or motion to backwards-indent lines

	- b & w = Jump backwards and forwards to the next word / different format of text (no need for space)
	
	- W = Jump to the next space-separated text
	
	- e = Go to the ending of a word 
	
	- gg = Go to the first line
	
	- G = Go to the last line
	
	- \<number>gg / \<number>G = Go to line \<number>
	
	- p = Pastes either the last thing yanked or deleted


	- d$ = deletes from the cursor to the end of the line - 
	
	- 0 = deletes from the beginning of the line to the cursor
	
	- $ = Go to the end of the line
	
	- _ = Go to the start of the line
	
	- 0 = Go to the beginning character of the line


- #### MOTION COMBINATIONS
	- f\<char\> = Goes forward to the specified character in the line
		- Can be combined with x to eliminate certain characters
			 
	- t\<char\> = Jumps to right before the specified character in the line (e.g. > )
		- Used with t\<char\> or f\<char\>
			- , = Go to the previous instance (but right before it)
			- ; = Go to the next instance (but right before it)
			
	- F\<char\> = Goes backwards to the specified character in the line (e.g. <) 
		
	- T\<char\> = Jumps to right after the previous specified character in the line (e.g. = ) 
		- T\<char\> is a mirror of t\<char\>, same with f \& F
		- Used with T\<char\> or F\<char\>

- ##### Both t / T \& f / F can be used with d, c, y, v (visual mode) \& p

	- df\<char\> deletes From the cursor to the next specified character in the line 
	- dF\<char\> deletes From the cursor to the previous specified character in the line
	- dt\<char\> deletes from the cursor To right before the next specified character in the line
	- dT\<char\> deletes from the cursor To right after the previous specified character in the line 
	
	- vf\<char\> selects From the cursor to the next specified character in the line 
	- vF\<char\> selects From the cursor to the previous specified character in the line
	- vt\<char\> selects from the cursor To right before the next specified character in the line
	- vT\<char\> selects from the cursor To right after the previous specified character in the line 
	
	
	- yf\<char\> yanks From the cursor to the next specified character in the line 
	- yF\<char\> yanks From the cursor to the previous specified character in the line
	- yt\<char\> yanks from the cursor To right before the next specified character in the line
	- yT\<char\> yanks from the cursor To right after the previous specified character in the line 
	
	
	- cf\<char\> changes From the cursor to the next specified character in the line 
	- cF\<char\> changes From the cursor to the previous specified character in the line
	- ct\<char\> changes from the cursor To right before the next specified character in the line
	- cT\<char\> changes from the cursor To right after the previous specified character in the line 
	
	
	- pf\<char\> pastes From the cursor to the next specified character in the line 
	- pF\<char\> pastes From the cursor to the previous specified character in the line
	- pt\<char\> pastes from the cursor To right before the next specified character in the line
	- pT\<char\> pastes from the cursor To right after the previous specified character in the line


### INSERT:

- i = Enter insert mode right on the cursor
	- I = Enter insert mode, but position the cursor at the beginning of the line
- a = Enter insert mode, but right after the cursor
	- A = Enter insert mode, but right over the end of the line
- o = Enter insert mode, but in a new line below the one we're in
	- O = Enter insert mode, but in a new line above the one we're in
 

### VISUAL:

- % = Used like, for example, Vf(%, it selects from the { to its matching }
    - It allows you to jump between sets of characters ( {}, (), ' ', etc. )

- V = Selects current line (can overwrite it by pasting it)
- VD = Visually delete a whole line, technically faster than double tapping "d"
- VY = Faster way to do the same as 'yy'

- vi<delimiter> = Selects everything in between the delimiters ( {}, [], (), etc)
- va<delimiter> = Selects everything (like vi) in and around (including the delimiters)
- ya<delimiter> = Yanks with the same selection as va would do
- viw = Selects in visual mode the whole word, doesn't care about positioning
- viW = Same as viw but selects all text until there are whitespaces
- o = Transfers your cursor to the top or bottom of the current visual selection 
- vap & dap = They select / delete paragraphs AND the contiguous whitespace
- vip & dip = They select / delete only the insides of the paragraphs
